        <h1>Installation Instructions</h1>
        <p>The controller code is designed to detect what is linked and configure itself. Unless otherwise noted for a
            particular screen, simply:
        <ol>
            <li>Click on a screen image below to go to the json for that configuration.</li>
            <li>Copy the raw JSON content of the file.</li>
            <li>In Dual Universe, right click on a programming board, go to advanced, then select "Paste Lua
                configuration from clipboard".
                <br>You should get a "Lua script loaded" confirmation message. If this is not the case try pasting the
                json in notepad to confirm that the right file is in the clipboard.
            </li>
            <li>Go into build mode and link the programming board to a screen, then leave build mode and (re-)activate the
                programming board. The screen will tell you the next element to link, if necessary.
                <br>The console will print out what slot is linked as what element to help debug connections if needed.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Antigravity Controller</h1>
        <hr>

        <div>
            <h2>Features/Controls</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>All anti-gravity measurements and controls on one screen.</li>
                <li>Set target altitude by dragging the arrow on the left side of the altitude scale or with the up and down arrows. Left/right arrows select the digit to change to step at anywhere from 1 to 10,000 m increments.
                    <ul><li>The altitude scale is logarithmic for more control at lower altitudes.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Snap target altitude to current altitude in one click on the current altitude slider.</li>
                <li>Lock controls to prevent accidental clicks by clicking on the lock icon.</li>
                <li>Power on and unlock protected by a drag-to-activate mechanism to prevent accidental disabling.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Anti-Gravity Generator (of appropriate size for ship core and with the appropriate number of pulsors
                    linked to it)</li>
                <li>1x Programming Board</li>
                <li>1x Screen</li>
                <li>Databank (optional, for remembering controller state between sessions)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <ul class="gallery">
            <li><a href="templates/antigravity-basic.json"><img
                        src="images/antigravity-basic.svg" alt="Basic Antigravity Controller"></a>

        </ul>

        <div>
            <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
            <h3>Anti-Gravity Generator doesn't lift ship</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The ship isn't under active control: either sit in the controller seat or activate a remote controller.</li>
                <li>Make sure it's activated: if the power button on the top right section has a red ring instead of a green bar click on it to turn on the Anti-Gravity Generator element.</li>
                <li>Make sure you have enough pulsors placed and that they are linked to the Anti-Gravity Generator.</li>
                <li>Make sure you're at no less than 1,000m altitude.</li>
                <li>Make sure the current base altitude is within 500m of ship altitude. It may take some time to get there.</li>
                <li>In some cases it may be necessary to unlink the pulsors from the Anti-Gravity Generator and re-link them if nothing else works.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Can't edit altitude</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure the programming board is turned on: either enable it before you get in the control seat or use a switch or other element to send an on signal to it.</li>
                <li>If a green lock icon is in the top left corner then the controls are locked. Click on it and drag to the right to unlock.</li>
            </ul>
